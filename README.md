The Client.java file is responsible for establishing a connection with the server and enabling users to send and receive messages in real time. Once the client connects to the server, it continuously listens for incoming messages while also allowing users to type and send their messages to the chat. To use this file, first ensure the Server.java is running, then execute Client.java multiple times to simulate multiple users in the chat room. The program provides a simple way to exchange messages, and users can type "exit" to leave the chat. The client application utilizes Java sockets and multi-threading to facilitate real-time communication across different users.
